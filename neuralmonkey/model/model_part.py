    """Base class for Neural Monkey model parts.

    Neural Monkey dynamically decides which model parts are in use when using a
    specific trainer or a runner. Each trainer/runner holds a reference to a
    top-level model part, which is then responsible for collecting references
    to all `Parameterized` and `Feedable` objects that contribute to the
    computation of its Tensors. This behavior is implemented using the
    `get_dependencies` method, which is called recursively on all instances of
    `GenericModelPart` class that are references from within a model part.

    Apart from the `get_dependencies` method, this class also provides the
    `dependencies` property which store the names of the Python class
    attributes that are regarded as potential dependents of the
    `GenericModelPart` object. These dependents are automatically checked for
    type and when they are instances of the `GenericModelPart` class, results
    of their `get_dependencies` are united and returned as dependencies of the
    current object.
